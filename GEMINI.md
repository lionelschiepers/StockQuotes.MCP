# StockQuotes.MCP

## Project Overview

This is a .NET project for creating a server to fetch stock quotes. The project is currently in its initial state, with only the basic git repository structure and a Visual Studio `.gitignore` file. There is no source code yet.

## Building and Running

- 'npm run build' for building
- 'npm test' for testing
- 'npm run format' for formatting the code
- 'npm run lint' for linting the code

## Development Conventions

- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- Don't update git.
- Lint and Format the project for each code modification.
